\begin{itemize}
    \item To find a appropriate kernel using 2-expansion lemma for feedback vertex set.
    \item Analyzing the performance when 
    instead of doing iterative compression algorithm directly to the input instance, 
    find a good kernel of the instance and then apply iterative compression algorithm.
    \item Minimum dominating set problem can be parameterized by the treewidth. 
    Vertex cover of a graph is a dominating set but it may not be the minimum. Finding 
    if it can be parameterized by the vertex cover size.
    \item Implement a good approximation algorithm for feedback vertex set.
